A Beginning,
A Beginning (Take 4) / Don’t Pass Me By (Take 7)," This is the introduction to Ringo's ""Don't Pass Me By"" Take 4   I listen for your footsteps Coming up the drive Listen for your footsteps But they don't arrive Waiting for your knock dear On my old front door I don't hear it Does it mean you don't love me any more?  I hear the clock a'ticking On the mantle shelf See the hands a'moving But I'm by myself I wonder where you are tonight And why I'm by myself I don't see you Does it mean you don't love me any more? Don't pass me by Don't make me cry Don't make me blue 'Cause you know, darling, I love only you You'll never know it hurt me so I hate to see you go Don't pass me by Don't make me cry  I'm sorry that I doubted you I was so unfair You were in a car crash And you lost your hair You said that you would be late About an hour or two I said that's alright I'm waiting here Just waiting to hear from you  Don't pass me by Don't make me cry Don't make me blue 'Cause you know, darling, I love only you You'll never know it hurt me so I hate to see you go Don't pass me by Don't make me cry I listen for your footsteps Coming up the drive Listen for your footsteps But they don't arrive Waiting for your knock dear On my old front door I don't hear it Does it mean you don't love me any more?  Don't pass me by Don't make me cry Don't make me blue 'Cause you know, darling, I love only you You'll never know it hurt me so I hate to see you go Don't pass me by Don't make me cry  I'm waiting for you, honey Hurry up to me I don't want you to pass me by I don't want you to make me cry I want you to make me happy Happy, happy 'Cause that's what I want This is so friendly This is so friendly This is so friendlyEmbed"

Beatles For Sale - Foreward,"This is the fourth by the four. 'Please, Please Me', 'With The Beatles', 'Hard Day's Night'. That's three. Now...'Beatles For Sale'. The young men themselves aren't for sale. Money, noisy though it is, doesn't talk that loud. But you can buy this album - you probably have, unless you're just browsing, in which case don't leave any dirty fingerprints on the sleeve! It isn't all currency or current though. There's priceless history between the covers. None of us is getting any younger. When, in a generation or so, a radio-active, cigar-smoking child, picnicking on Saturn, asks you what The Beatles affair was all about - ;Did you actually know them?'- don't try to explain all about the long hair and the screams! Just play the child a few tracks from this album and he'll probably understand what it is all about. The kids of AD 2000 will draw from this music much the sam sense of well being and warmth we do today. For the magic of The Beatles is, I suspect, timeless and ageless. It has broken all frontiers and barriers. It has cut through differences of race, age, and class. It is adored by the world. This album has some lovely samples of Beatles music. It has, for instance, eight new titles wrought by the incomparable John Lennon and Paul Mccartney, and mingling with the new, there are six numbers culled from the rhythmic wealth of the past extraordinary decade; pieces like Kansas City, and Rock and Roll Music. Marvelous. Many hours and hard day's nights of devoted industry went into the production of this album. It isn't a potboiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-christmas mixture. At least three of the Lennon-Mccartney songs were seriously considered as single releases until John popped up with I Feel Fine. These three were Eight Days A Week, No Reply and I'm A Loser. Each would have topped the charts, but as it is they are an adornment to this LP, and a lesson to other artists. As on other albums, The Beatles have tossed in far more value than the market usually demands. There are few gimmicks or recording tricks, though for effect, The Beatles and their recording manager George Martin have slipped in some novelties. Like Paul on Hammond organ to introduce drama into Mr. Moonlight, which also, and for the first time, has George Harrison applying a thump to an elderly African drum because Ringo was busy elsewhere in the studio, playing bongos. George's thump remains on the track. The bongos were later dropped. Ringo plays timpani in Every Little Thing, and on the Rock and Roll Music track George Martin joins John and Paul on one piano. On Words of Love, Ringo plays a packing case. Beyond this, it is a straightforward 1964 disc-making. Quite the best of it's kind in the world. There is little or nothing on the album that cannot be reproduced on stage, which is, as students and critics of pop-music know, not always the case. Here it is then. The best album yet-quite definitely, says John, Paul, George, and Ringo-full of everything which made the four the biggest attraction the world has ever known. Full of raw John and Melodic Paul; a number from George, and a bonus from Ringo. For those who like to know who does exactly what, there are details alongside each title.Embed"

Fab Four on Film,"INTERVIEWER: Do you think the bug has bitten now? Are you guys – do you have big eyes now to be actors? PAUL: No. GEORGE: Not really, no. We still, you know, even if our film – this, A Hard Day’s Night – is the biggest box office attraction ever, you know, it still won’t make us feel as though we’re actors. But I think we’d all enjoy making a new film. RINGO: Yeah, it’s good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we’ve sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we’re not supposed to look at the camera, you’d always sort of find yourself turning ‘round and smiling at it.  You’d just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know. PAUL: And on this one, I don’t know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling. RINGO: Yeah. PAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know. We’d sort of say a line, and I kept doing it a particular way. There was one line I kept saying to Ringo, it’s about the grandfather in the film who goes off to— RINGO: Well, we can’t tell you, ‘cause we’ll ruin the film, you see! PAUL: We can’t tell you  but it was just this one thing where the grandfather goes off to a club, and I was supposed to say to Ringo “It’s all your fault” and things. ‘Cause in the film actually, although it’s not true in real life, we sort of pick on Ringo a bit, you know, because it was obvious really, because he’s sort of smaller and it looks funny in the film. But I’m supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying “It’s all your fault” and things. And as I was saying it, I’m a bit – I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don’t know why, I must have thought I was a good actor!  And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, “It’s all your fault!”  Flapping my arms around, and he couldn’t stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit. RINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit. PAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something.  RINGO: Yeah. PAUL: They cut some of it. RINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven’t printed or put on the film, but it’s great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, “Remember that bit?” if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up.Embed"

Historical Notes,"The group's ninth album in the UK was called simply The Beatles but quickly became better known as 'The White Album'. The double-LP was issued on the fifth anniversary of the release of their second album With The Beatles - 22nd November, 1968. The Beatles released 34 new tracks in 1968 - returning to the high level of productivity they had maintained from 1963 to 1965. The first music of the year came in March with the arrival of their seventeenth single 'Lady Madonna'. Soon after it was recorded, the Beatles flew to Rishikesh, India for several weeks of mediation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and they enjoyed a prolific period of song writing at this remote location. They began recording these new songs at Abbey Road on 30th May and studio work occupied most of their time until the final session on 16th October. Two songs from this period were released as a single on 30th August, 1968 - 'Hey Jude' and 'Revolution'. It was the first Beatles record to be pressed with the Apple label and the Parlophone imprint was also replaced for the two LP discs comprising The Beatles. Any expectations of a cover to rival the vivid art work of Sgt. Pepper of Magical Mystery tour were immediately overturned. The outside of the sleeve was completely white was the only lettering consisting of 'The Beatles' embossed on the front and also printed on the spine with the catalogue number. Early copies also had an individual number stamped on the front. However, in contrast to the minimalistic look, some generous inserts were slipped alongside the records. There were four glossy color photographs of the individual Beatles and a large fold out poster displaying a photo collage on one side and lyrics on the other. Despite being an expensive double album, The Beatles was a huge seller. It entered the UK chart at number one and remained there for a total of eight of the 22 weeks it was listed. In the USA, it topped the charts of nine weeks and stayed in the album chart for an initial run of 65 weeks. As with Sgt. Pepper, no singles were released from 'The White Album' in the UK and USA during the sixties. Amid the sessions for The Beatles, the animated film Yellow Submarine was given it's UK premier on 17th July. The soundtrack LP featured four new Beatles songs and was in the shops eight weeks after the release of The Beatles.Embed"

O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot  A day or two ago, the story I must tell I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away  Now the ground is white, go it while you're young Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead Embed"

Recording Notes,"To complete the many songs needed for their double-LP, The Beatles recorded regularly during twenty weeks from 30th May to 16th October 1968. The final studio date was a 24-hour marathon session to create the running order for the four sides of the album and the edits and cross-fades between the songs. The sessions mark an important turning point in their recording career because it was during this period that The Beatles first recorded on an eight-track tape machine. Since 1964, the group had used four-track for all their album albums by but 1966, they found their musical arrangements usually required more tracks than were available. The solution was the create extra ones by copying the first four tracks to a second blank tape and simultaneously mixing some of them together to leave free as many racks as were needed for addition overdubs. 'Bouncing Down' was a time consuming process because the tracks that were being mixed together would form part of the final sound balance of the completed song so it was important to be satisfied with the mix before overdubbing commenced. With eight tracks now available, the problem was eliminated - until even more were needed. Work began on the album using four tracks and, while some songs could be confined to these, most had to be 'bounced down' to a second, third, or even - as with 'Revolution 1' and 'Ob-LA-Di, Ob-La-Da' - a fourth tape. The Beatles' first experience of using an eight track recording at Abbey Road was during a session on 3rd September for 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. As it had been started  on four-track. the master was transferred to an eight-track machine to allow further overdubbing. However, 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' was re-recorded on eight-track from scratch two days later with a guest appearance by Eric Clapton. and completed on 6th September with several overdubs. George's decision to ask a friend to play on his song was a significant one. Although The Beatles had previously used other musicians on their sessions, they had been from other areas of music such as classical, jazz or Indian music. For the first time, here was a star musician performing on an instrument already featured in the group. The album's long sessions would often begin in the afternoon and continue until daybreak the next morning. There were also occastions when two songs were recorded at the same time in separate studios. In July, engineer Geoff Emerick left the sessions and did not work with the group again until nearly a year later the Abbey Road. Ken Scott, who has first sat at the mixing desk for some of the Magical Mystery Tour songs, recored and mixed two thirds of 'The White Album'. For one week, George Matin relinquished his seat in the room so that he could take a holiday and, consequently, his 21-year old production assistant Chris Thomas supervised sessions.Embed"

The Beatles’ Christmas Record," Hoo!  Good King Wenceslas looked out On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!) As the slow ray round about Deep and crisp and crispy Brightly show the boot last night On the mosty cruel Henry Hall and David Lloyd Betty Grable too  Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show  (whistling)  This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime: Garry Crimble to you Garry Mimble to you Getty Bable, dear Christmas Happy Birthday me too  This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing  Yes! Yes! Oh yes!  Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...  Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!  ...to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...  Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!  ...so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription  Ja, das wird uns danke schon Und denn gruss von even Ja, denn gruss von even schon Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy Danke schon Ja, Ringo! Hello, Ringo here As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups... (Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas) Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted (Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas) King Wenceslas: Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!) On the feast of Stephen (Hey!) When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!) Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!) Hooray! Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!) I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters And I'd just like to say: Brightly was the shone that night Though the winter cruel When a pork pie came inside Gathering winter cruel Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!) Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!) When ev'rybody picked it... Ha, ha, ha, ha... Oh yeah! Oh! Rudolph, the red nosed Ringo (Rudolph!) Had a very shiny nose Merry Christmas everybody!Embed"

Yellow Submarine - Script," NARRATOR: Once upon a time, or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland. Eighty thousand leagues beneath the sea it lay... or lie, I'm not too sure.  CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe. It must be scratched. Right, Max? MAX: Yes, Your Blueness. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: What?! We Meanies only take NO for an answer. Is that understood, Max? MAX: No, Your Blueness. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: That's better. Are the troops in readiness? MAX: No, Your Blueness. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: The Bonkers? MAX: No. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: Clowns? MAX: No. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: Snapping Turks? MAX: No. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: Anti-music missiles? MAX: No. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: The dreadful Flying Glove? MAX: No. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: Splendid! Today, Pepperland goes blooey! Fire!  FRED: The Meanies are coming! The Meanies are coming! CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: Glove, Glove, come here, Glove! Look out there, and what do you see? Tell him, Max. MAX: Someone running, Glove. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: Yes. Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey? Go, Glove, point! And having pointed, pounce down! I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii! What?! What?! What?! The Glove is losing his touch. Do your worst! Explode them! FRED : It's not polite to point! CHIEF BLUE MEANIE: Thing of beauty... Destroy it for ever! FRED : Sir, Sir, the Meanies are coming! MAYOR: Not here, young Fred. They wouldn't dare. FRED: They would. They are. What are you going to do? MAYOR: Finish the quartet. BLUE MEANIES: Fire!  FRED: Trio, sir.  FRED: Duet, sir. MAYOR Duet?  FRED: Solo! MAYOR: Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!  MAYOR: 4 scores and 32 bars ago our forefathers... FRED: Our quartet? MAYOR: And foremothers... FRED: Another quartet? MAYOR: Made it in this yellow submarine... FRED: What, that little thing? MAYOR: To Pepperland. Climb aboard, young Fred. FRED: But, sir, I can't even make my soap float. MAYOR: I'm appointing you Lord Admiral. FRED: Lord Admiral? In that event, yes. MAYOR: Hurry, Young Fred. Go! Get help! FRED: Where should I go? MAYOR: No time for trivialities.

All the lonely people Where do they all come from? All the lonely people, where do they all belong? Father McKenzie Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear No-one comes near Look at him working Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there What does he care? All the lonely people, where do they all come from? All the lonely people, where do they all belong? Ah, look at all the lonely people Ah, look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby Died in the church and was buried along with her name Nobody came Father McKenzie Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave No-one was saved All the lonely people, where do they all come from? All the lonely people, where do they all belong?  RINGO: Who... is me? Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl. Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.  BOBBY: Puss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy.  Ahem, er... RINGO: Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine? BOBBY: No, I would not. RINGO: Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.  RINGO: I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination. But I don't have an imagination.  FRED: Help, help, help! RINGO : Thanks, I don't need any. FRED: Help! Won't you please, please help me? RINGO: Be specific. FRED: ... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!! RINGO: What you need is... FRED: 'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent, 'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-p-p-please help.   VOZ: Hiya, baby!  RINGO: Your story has touched my heart. Jump in, we'll get my friends. FRED: Bless you! RINGO: Did I sneeze?  FRED: Just park it here. RINGO: I'll just park it here.  FRED: What would your friends be doing here? RINGO: Displaying. FRED: Displaying what? RINGO: Displaying around.  FRED: Can't we take one of these? RINGO: No, Fred, I only work with me mates. FRED: Frankenstein? RINGO: I used to go out with his sister. FRED: His sister? RINGO: Yeah. Phyllis. Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever. FRED: You mustn't do that. RINGO: Can't help it. I'm a born lever-puller.  JOHN: Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream. RINGO: I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach. Now listen to old Fred. FRED: ... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!! RINGO: What do you think? JOHN: I think he needs a rehearsal.  JOHN: When do we leave? RINGO: Let's get the other two, John. JOHN: What day is it? RINGO: Sitar-day. JOHN: Then George will be here.   RINGO: George, what are you doing up there? GEORGE : Now, what is it, Ringo? Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down? RINGO : This chap here... FRED : ...Blue Meanies!!! GEORGE: You're nuts, the pair of you. RINGO: Wait a minute, that's my car. GEORGE: How do you know it's your car? RINGO: I'd know it anywhere. GEORGE: What's it look like, then? RINGO: It's red with yellow wheels. I mean, blue with orange wheels. GEORGE: It's all in the mind.  RINGO: Come on, move over, I'm driving. GEORGE: I got here first.  RINGO/GEORGE: I'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.  JOHN: Do you think we're interrupting something? RINGO: I think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?  GEORGE: It's all in the mind. JOHN: Try one of those doors.  GEORGE: Yes, they do look very nice, don't they? RINGO: Yes, they do. JOHN: They do, though, don't they? GEORGE: Yes, they do. RINGO: Don't dey, dough? GEORGE: Dough?  JOHN: Don't ask. Dat's dough. PAUL: What's the matter, folks? RINGO: Blue Meanies. FRED: Well, lads, what do you think? JOHN : I think that... FRED: Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think? PAUL: Well, then, um... FRED: Pounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that? JOHN: Well, I think that... RINGO: As a matter of fact, I... ALL BEATLES: I think... FRED: Well? RINGO: I've forgotten.  FRED: Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape. JOHN: I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.  We see a series of landscapes. We hear the end of “A day in the life”.  PAUL: So, this is a submarine. JOHN: Soft, isn't it? RINGO: Not if you're on the bottom. FRED: All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to. PAUL: Groovy. How do you start this thing? FRED: It starts with a Blue Meanie attack. JOHN: Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood? FRED: Then you start looking for a switch. RINGO: Perhaps this is it.   One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more? Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea? E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you Sail the ship Chop the tree Skip the rope Look at me All together now All together now (all together now)… Black, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed? Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now) All together now (all together now), all together now (all together now)... Sail the ship Chop the tree Skip the rope Look at me All together now All together now (all together now)…  RINGO: What time is it? JOHN: It's time to time. PAUL: Look, the hands are slowing down.  PAUL: Do you ever get the feeling... JOHN: Yeah. PAUL: … that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface? RINGO: What's happening, John? JOHN: Well, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory. GEORGE: All right. JOHN: Relatively speaking, that is. GEORGE: Of course. Maybe time's gone on strike. RINGO: What for? GEORGE: Shorter hours. RINGO: I don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it? JOHN & PAUL: Why? RINGO: It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it? JOHN: You surprise me, Ringo. RINGO: Why? JOHN: Dealing in abstracts. RINGO: Just because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny.  PAUL : You're not half the lad you used to be. GEORGE  Look, everything's getting bigger. JOHN : It's not. It's us that are getting smaller... RINGO : I want my mam. FRED: And younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this. RINGO  Look at that! GEORGE: It's all a load of Father Xmas's. JOHN: It's not. It's Father Time. GEORGE: How do you know? JOHN: I read it in a book. FRED: I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards. GEORGE: What's that mean, old Fred? FRED: It means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence. JOHN: What are we gonna do, then? FRED: We could always try a few buttons. RINGO : I want my mam. FRED: Time's fast running out for us, I'm afraid! JOHN: Can't we do something to the clock? GEORGE: What do you mean, John? JOHN: Move the hands forward, see what happens. FRED: Clever lad.  JOHN: Something strange is happening. It's speeding up now. PAUL : Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own. JOHN: Uncannily. RINGO: There's someone in it. Look. JOHN: And they're waving. RINGO: It's a group of fellas. JOHN: Wave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet. RINGO: There's only two of us. JOHN: Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves… FRED: Going backwards... JOHN: … in time! GEORGE: Look at Ringo.  JOHN: Oh dear, we're all the same. PAUL: Senile delinquents. GEORGE: And I can hear my beard growing. RINGO: We'd better do something.  When I get older, losing my hair Many years from now Will you still be sending me a valentine Birthday greetings, bottle of wine If I'd been out till quarter to three Would you lock the door? Will you still need me, will you still feed me When I'm sixty-four? You'll be older, too And if you say the word I could stay with you I could be handy mending a fuse When your lights have gone You can knit a sweater by the fireside Sunday mornings, go for a ride [A text can be read: “sixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a long time… Let us demonstrate”.] Doing the garden, digging the weeds Who could ask for more? Will you still need me, will you still feed me When I'm sixty-four? Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear We shall scrimp and save Grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck and Dave Send me a postcard, drop me a line Stating point of view Indicate precisely what you mean to say Yours sincerely, wasting away Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more Will you still need me, will you still feed me When I'm sixty-four? JOHN: Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time? RINGO: That would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old? JOHN: What kind of a sea is this? FRED: The Sea of Science. JOHN: Oh, yeah.  If you're listening to this song You may think the chords are going wrong But they're not He just wrote it like that When you're listening late at night You may think the band are not quite right But they are They just play it like that It doesn't really matter What chords I play What words I say Or time of day it is Cause it's only a Northern Song It doesn't really matter What clothes I wear Or how I fare or if my hair is brown When it's only a Northern Song If you think the harmony Is a little dark and out of key You're correct There's nobody there And I told you there's no-one there.   GEORGE: He looks wrong. PAUL: He doesn't look at all well. GEORGE: In fact, he's horrible. JOHN : He's so ugly. ALL: Really ugly!  FRED: Somebody push a button.   JOHN: There's a cyclops. PAUL: Can't be. He's got two eyes. JOHN: Then it must be a bi-cyclops. GEORGE: There's another one. JOHN: A whole cyclopedia.  JOHN: There's a school of whales. RINGO: They look a bit old for school. PAUL: University, then. RINGO : University of Whales. They look like dropouts to me. FRED: You've got to steer clear! RINGO: Steer clear? FRED: Yes, steer. Clear? RINGO: Yes, dear.  FRED: Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button. RINGO: Which button? FRED: That one. RINGO: This one?  FRED: That was the panic button. PAUL: Poor Ringo. JOHN: Poor lad. GEORGE: Never did no harm to no-one. JOHN: Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do? FRED: Learn to sing trios. PAUL: No, let's save the poor devil. JOHN: I see footsteps. FRED: It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts. JOHN: Preparing to attack.  JOHN: I don't half miss Ringo. PAUL: He's far out there. JOHN: Always was. RINGO: 'H' is for hurry! PAUL: Here comes Ringo!  JOHN: There goes Ringo.  GEORGE: It's seen us. FRED: Find a boxing button. PAUL: Whoever heard of a boxing button? JOHN: Who cares? Find one.  FRED : Fire one!  FRED: Uh-oh, wrong one. JOHN: That.  GEORGE: There goes Ringo again. JOHN: Rides well, doesn't he? RINGO: 'E' is for ergent...  FRED: Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum again. PAUL: We'll be sucked into oblivion. GEORGE: Or even further. FRED: Put her in reverse. JOHN: So long, sucker. PAUL: Too much. GEORGE: Too soon. FRED: Reverse! Reverse! JOHN: Ringo time.  RINGO: 'L' is for love me...  JOHN: Indians! RINGO: Help! Help! 'P' is for please... JOHN: So, press a button.  JOHN: How was it, Ringo? RINGO : 'Arrowing.  FRED: Look who's back. Full speed ahead. RINGO: Oh, no. JOHN: The motor's packing in. FRED: By all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we do? PAUL: Serve tea. JOHN: Lovely.   FRED: By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out. JOHN: Maybe we should call a road service. PAUL: Can't. No road. RINGO: And we're not sub-scribers. JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE: Subscribers! Oh! GEORGE: I know something about motors. Let me have a look. FRED: Here. GEORGE: Is that the motor? FRED: Can't you tell one when you see one? GEORGE: Of course I can. Let me peruse it.  JOHN: What do you think? GEORGE: I think I burned my finger. RINGO : Here, lads. Look at this. JOHN: What do you think it is? GEORGE: Nothing. RINGO: Looks like nothing. PAUL: It's a local inhabitant. RINGO: He's probably one of the nothings. PAUL: At least that's something. Let's show him our motor. JOHN: Steady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody. GEORGE: But this is a nobody. JEREMY: Medic, pedic, zed oblique, orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek. Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo. So little time, so much to know. JOHN: Can you tell us where we're at? JEREMY: A true Socratic query, that. JOHN: And who the Billy Shears are you? JEREMY: Who? Who indeed am I?  JOHN : Jeremy? PAUL : Hillary? GEORGE : Boob? RINGO : Ph. D? ALL: Who? JEREMY: Eminent physicist, polyglot classicist, prize-winning botanist, hard biting satirist, talented pianist, good dentist, too. JOHN: Lousy poet. JEREMY: Critic's voice, take your choice. RINGO: Must be one of them angry young men. PAUL: Or a daffy old creep. JEREMY: I, daffy old creep? GEORGE: Do you speak English? JEREMY: Old English, middle, a dialect, pure... PAUL: Well, do you speak English? JEREMY: You know, I'm not sure. RINGO: He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows. PAUL: Why don't we show him our motor? JOHN: Should we really... show him our motor? PAUL: He may not have seen one before. JEREMY: Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring. Metrocyclonic and stereophonic, This motor, I see, has a broken down thing. JOHN: He fixed it? PAUL: He fixed it. GEORGE: Great. Let's go. JEREMY: I must complete my bust, two novels, finish my blueprints, begin my beguine. JOHN: Must you always talk in rhyme? JEREMY: If I spoke prose, you'd all find out, I don't know what I talk about. Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo. So little time, so much to know. PAUL: Hey, fellas. Look. JEREMY: The footnotes for my 19th book. This is my standard procedure for doing it. And while I compose it, I'm also reviewing it. GEORGE: A boob for all seasons. PAUL: How can he lose? JOHN: Were your notices good? JEREMY: It's my policy never to read my reviews. JOHN: There must be a word for what he is.  He's a real Nowhere Man Sitting in his Nowhere Land Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody Doesn't have a point of view, Knows not where he's going to Isn't he a bit like you and me Nowhere Man, please listen, You don't know what you're missing Nowhere Man, the world is at your command He's as blind as he can be, Just sees what he wants to see Nowhere Man, can you see me at all? Nowhere Man, don't worry, Take your time, don't hurry Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand Doesn't have a point of view, Knows not where he's going to Isn't he a bit like you and me Nowhere Man, please listen, You don't know what you're missing Nowhere Man, the world is at your command He's a real Nowhere Man, Sitting in his nowhere land Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody JOHN: Okay, men, all aboard. Let's go somewhere. RINGO: What about him? JOHN: He's happy enough going around in circles. RINGO: Poor little fella. PAUL: I don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist. RINGO: Look at him. Can't he come with us?  Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like. JEREMY: You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man? RINGO: Come on, we'll take you somewhere.  JOHN  Okay, Booby. Down the hatch. JEREMY : Down the hatch. A quite curious phrase. The middle South Midlands Victorian phase. It's usage undoubtedly on the increase. I must work it into my New Statesman piece. JOHN: That's the hatch, friend. JEREMY: Indeed. FRED: Steady now, crew. Prepare to go forward. GEORGE: Forward. PAUL: Forward. JOHN: Forward. RINGO: Forward. ALL: Forward!  JOHN: It's awfully quiet. GEORGE: What shall we do, Jeremy? JEREMY: Repair, revive, revamp, renew. Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.  JEREMY: Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob. JOHN: What's he saying? PAUL: What's he doing? JEREMY: Chewing gum will do the job. A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new.  FRED: I can't stop her. 'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent, 'L' is for love me… JOHN: 'P' is for... goodbye? GEORGE: That was lovely, Jeremy. PAUL: We've lost the sub for good. JOHN: Or for bad. Or for worse. JEREMY: I'm sorry about that. RINGO: But he did fix the motor. PAUL: Where are we?  JOHN: It looks like the foothills. PAUL: The foothills of what? JOHN: The foothills of the headlands.  Picture yourself in a boat on a river With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly A girl with kaleidoscope eyes Cellophane flowers of yellow and green Towering over your head Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers That grow so incredibly high Newspaper taxis appear on the shore Waiting to take you away Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Lucy in the sky with diamonds Picture yourself on a train in a station With Plasticine porters with looking glass ties Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile The girl with kaleidoscope eyes Lucy in the sky with diamonds…  JOHN: Carry on, lads, carry on. RINGO: Certainly was carrying on. JOHN: I feel a draft. PAUL: We must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions? JOHN  Excuse us... PAUL: Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?  JOHN: Thanks. PAUL: Gosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from? JEREMY: A chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment... RINGO: Condi... JEREMY: A spice. JOHN: He's right, you know. It's pepper. PAUL: Pepper? GEORGE: Pepper.   RINGO: John? Paul? George? Is anybody home? PAUL: Where are we? JOHN: A holey sea. This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire. PAUL: Oh, boy... GEORGE: How many do you think there are in all? JEREMY: Enough to fill the Albert Hall. PAUL: Didn't old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes just before the Sea of Green? JOHN: Yeah. GEORGE: Through one of them spots must be the Sea of Green. But which? Which one? JEREMY: Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation. JOHN: Jeremy, what do you know about holes? JEREMY: There are simply no holes in my education. PAUL: You mean you haven't composed a whole book? GEORGE: Great. What shall we do? JEREMY: Be empirical. Look. RINGO: The booby's making more and more sense. PAUL: It's getting better all the time. JOHN: Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green. The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green. JEREMY: Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine. I think we're near the Sea of Green.  RINGO: I've got a hole in me pocket. PAUL: Where's Jeremy? JOHN: He was over there. GEORGE: He's not here now. PAUL: He must have jumped ship, then. RINGO: He wouldn't do that. He's our friend. Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?    JOHN: Pepperland. A bit salty around the edges. Looks all dingy. GEORGE: And drab. PAUL: And quiet.  JOHN: Safe at last. PAUL: And none the worse for our adventures. JOHN: Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses. RINGO: There's an eye in the apples.  FRED: There she blows! Lord Mayor, sir... I've made it, I'm back. GEORGE: Who's this? FRED: Our Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. . Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself. Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again. JOHN: All right, let's sing.  Have you got time to rectify, time to rectify... MAYOR: Do I hear music? Do I see... young Fred? FRED: You do, Lord Mayor. MAYOR: Bless my metronome. And did you bring the help? FRED: Yes, yes. Look. MAYOR: Holy pizzicato, young Fred. It's quite uncanny, your faces... PAUL: We're quite cute, really. MAYOR: You could pass for the originals. JOHN: We are the originals.  MAYOR: No, no... Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. RINGO: They couldn't be much with a name like that. Sergeant Pepper? FRED You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion. MAYOR Where are your instruments? JOHN Lost in the Monstrous Sea. PAUL Sea of Monsters. FRED We'll get other instruments, Lord Mayor. MAYOR Not a chance. The Meanies captured everything that maketh music. PAUL They hate music that much, do they? MAYOR They shrink at the very sound. JOHN Okay, you guys. It's shrinking time in Pepperland. All people in Pepperland keeps grey and motionless (except for escape from the blue meanies). BLUE MEANIE Aim, fire! The Beatles hide behind cut-outs. PAUL He reminds me of my old English teacher. JOHN Look, if you must shout, shout quietly. GEORGE What do we do? JOHN Coagulate with the crowd. PAUL Cut-outs at the ready. JOHN Then let's cut out. They come to a high bandstand surrounded by thorns. PAUL What a grand bandstand. JOHN That's where the gear's kept. Come on. Blue meanies with dogs. GEORGE Cavey, cavey. At dusk. PAUL All right, the coast is clear. GEORGE Now's our chance. RINGO But how'll we get over? GEORGE Easy. Follow me. They jump the fence of thorns BLUE MEANIE A-ha! You fools! The watch fires his machine gun. The Beatles reach the bandstand moving between asleep blue meanies. RINGO It's not very light in here, is it? GEORGE Shh! Keep the noise down. JOHN Look what I found. It's their uniforms. PAUL Nice bit of gear, that. RINGO They'll look great on, eh? PAUL Dey will, won't dey? RINGO Won't dey, dough. JOHN How do I look? PAUL Groovy, groovy. How about me? RINGO, looking thru the window Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded. GEORGE Oh, heck. RINGO A million billion Meanies. PAUL They're coming this way. ALL Hide! Trying to hide they make a lot of noise. PAUL Do you think they heard us? JOHN I hope not. GEORGE What did you say? SOMEONE Shhhh! GEORGE Good plan. 1:03:22 DAWN, by Grieg. PAUL Look. They're all asleep. RINGO They look cute when they're asleep. Almost human. GEORGE Come on. Let's get out of here. PAUL On tiptoe. They take their instruments and go down the hill. RINGO Tiptoe through the Meanies... THE OTHER Shh! Ringo steps on the bagpipe. Some meanies wake. PAUL Let's exude. The Beatles are persecuted. Ringo falls down and jumps on the John arms. GEORGE Relax, lads. Not a Meanie in sight. JOHN Not even a teeny Meanie. PAUL Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie. RINGO Great. PAUL Oh, look. Breakfast. RINGO I'm dying for a bit of brekky. George takes an apple. Four tall meanies do the same. JOHN Look out. A blue meanie heads the four tall meanies. CHIEF Sound off, one, two, three, four... TALL MEANIES One, two, three, four... The Beatles, one above the other, march behind the row of tall meanies. JOHN Five. CHIEF Five?  Sound off, one, two, three, four. TALL MEANIES One, two, three... JOHN Four. John eliminates another one. TALL MEANIES One, two... JOHN Three. CHIEF Three? JOHN Two. CHIEF Two? JOHN One. CHIEF One?  Are you Bluish? You don't look Bluish. JOHN Run for it. The Beatles escape again. PAUL Right, men. We've made it. GEORGE Instruments at the ready. JOHN Okay, on the beat. A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six… RINGO Hey, can't you make it three? JOHN All right. On the beat of three... A-one, a-two, a-three... 1:06:34 THE BEATLES: SGT. PEPPER’S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND It was twenty years ago today, Sgt.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band THE BEATLES: WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS Billy Shears! What would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you stand up and walk out on me? Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song And I'll try not to sing out of key The inhabitants of Pepperland recover color and smile. Lennon has been presented as Billy Shears, but Ringo’s voice is heard. 01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF CHIEF BLUE MEANIE Ah! The hills are alive... ASSISTANT With the sound of music. The Chief Blue Meanie hits his assistant. Then he gets a tantrum. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE Who is responsible for this? ASSISTANT Rimsky Korsakov? The assistant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces. ASSISTANT Guy Lombardo? CHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue.  Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird. PEPPERLAND INHABITANTS Who? Who? Who? PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO Who? Who? Who? The mouth of John expels the question WHO? A blue big glove crosses the air. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE Ah! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts.  Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them! MEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine. CHIEF, exuberant The Glove, the Glove, the Glove! PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO Glove? Glove? Glove? From the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE. GEORGE He's a clever lad, isn't he? RINGO Open your mouth, it won't hurt.  John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you? GEORGE It's easy. All you need is love. JOHN Yes. And expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes. 1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE Love, love, love (x3) There's nothing you can do that can't be done Nothing you can sing that can't be sung Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game It's easy All you need is love All you need is love All you need is love, love, Love is all you need Nothing you can know that isn't known, Nothing you can see that isn't shown There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be It's easy All you need is love, (All together now) All you need is love, (Everybody) All you need is love, love, Love is all you need All you need is love All you need is love All you need is love, love The words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks. JOHN Go, Glove, lovely Glove. RINGO You took the words right out of my mouth, John. GEORGE Hey, wait, and watch.  It's all in the mind, you know. Love is all you need Love is all you need Everything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW. She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah The meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd. A little bit further they find a blue glass ball. GEORGE Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl. JOHN In Pepperland all things are possible. PAUL It's not a goldfish bowl. RINGO Just a big glass bowl, then. PAUL Yes, blue glass. RINGO It must be from Kentucky. Paul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound. JOHN There's something inside. RINGO Four fellas. GEORGE What are they doing there? PAUL They're not having a ball, that's for sure. JOHN It can't be. PAUL It's us. JOHN But we're here. PAUL It's Sgt. Pepper's... RINGO Lonely... GEORGE Hearts Club... GEORGE Band. JOHN The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward by Einstein… PAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron’ Any old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein. JOHN … could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs... The other three try to break the ball. PAUL John! JOHN … beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper... GEORGE John! JOHN George? GEORGE How do we get them out? JOHN Break the glass. GEORGE We can't. It's Beatle-proof. JOHN Nothing is Beatle-proof. PAUL, to Ringo Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it. RINGO No, I haven't. GEORGE Have a look in your pocket. 1:15:50 “Baby you’re a rich man” is heard. RINGO I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if... Ringo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty. RINGO Yeah, it still works. GEORGE We take back all we said. JOHN You're a genius. PAUL A sheer genius. RINGO I know, I know, I know.  Like coloured telly. GEORGE Like crystal. PAUL They're decanting. The members of the Band face their peers. RINGO 2 Hello, brother. RINGO Yeah, without a doubt. GEORGE We're the spitting image of each other. GEORGE 2 Golly, yeah. JOHN I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality. JOHN 2 Yes, I'm your alter-ego man. JOHN And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.  I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the skirmish must we hence. JOHN 2 Shall we hence? PAUL Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge! The Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide. JOHN We're surrounded. RINGO, pointing the four-headed dog Nice dog, though. The Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings: 1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG Sheepdog... standing in the rain Bullfrog... doing it again Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles What makes you think you're something special when you smile? Childlike... no one understands Jack knife... in your sweaty hands Some kind of innocence is measured out in years You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears You can talk to me You can talk to me You can talk to me If you're lonely you can talk to me Big man... walking in the park Wigwam... frightened of the dark Some kind of solitude is measured out in you You think you know me but you haven't got a clue You can talk to me, You can talk to me You can talk to me... if you're lonely you can talk to me Hey, bulldog (x4) John to the dog: What do you say? Sing it. Do you know any more? Play it! Todos Hey, bulldog. The Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from the branch of a tree. RINGO Jeremy, can it be you? JEREMY Can it be me? I think you'd better inquire of the guards, for when I was captured, they took all my cards. RINGO Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked. JEREMY What do you want me to do? Do you recommend fisticuffs versus the guard? Oh, guard! Blue Meanio! Left to the nostril, right uppercut, right to the eyebrow, left to the gut. Jeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo congratulates Jeremy. RINGO Jeremy! JEREMY Come on, Ringo! The Chief treats to stem the rout. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now! The Chief is swept along. CHIEF BLUE MEANIE My kingdom for a horse!  I think I'll tear him up into little pieces. JEREMY He does, does he? CHIEF I think I'll make a blueburger out of him. JEREMY Ha-ha, I don't care what you think. CHIEF You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that. JEREMY He does in truth seem quite annoyed, some reference material before I'm destroyed. Where ground is soft most often grows, Arise, arise, arouse, a rose. A rosy nose? CHIEF Speak your last piece! JEREMY Peace, peace, supplant the doom and the gloom. Turn off what is sour, turn into a flower and bloom, bloom. Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom, bloom, bloom... A lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy. RINGO First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody. JOHN You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go mingle. What do you say? CHIEF Max? MAX Your Blue... I mean your Newness! CHIEF, takes some flowers It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go? MAX Argentina? JOHN Are you with us? Will you join? CHIEF Shall we? MAX No!...  Yes, your Newness! CHIEF, smiles Yes, Max... JEREMY, close to them Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring, A true, universal, euphonious thing. In genders embracing and chasing of blues, the very best word for the whole world to use. Ha-ha! CHIEF Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of Happiness. 1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT’S ALL TOO MUCH It's all too much When I look into your eyes, Your love is there for me And the more I go inside, the more there is to see It's all too much for me to take The love that's shining all around here All the world is birthday cake, So take a piece but not too much Everybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of emotion. Nice to have the time to take this opportunity Time for me to look at you, and you to look at me It's all too much for me to see The love that's shining all around you Everywhere, it's what you make For us to take, it's all too much It's too much 1:26:55 PAUL, RINGO, GEORGE AND JOHN IN PERSON PAUL Catchy tune, that. RINGO I can't seem to get it out of my head. GEORGE Then shake it. RINGO That's what we've been doing all night. PAUL Yeah, it was a great party. GEORGE And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs. Here is the motor. PAUL I've got a little love. RINGO And I've got a hole in my pocket. PAUL A hole? RINGO Half a hole, anyway. I gave the rest to Jeremy. GEORGE What can he do with half a hole? PAUL Fix it to keep his mind from wandering. RINGO Look at John, will you? John has been looping through a telescope. PAUL What's the matter, John? Blue Meanies? JOHN Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre. There's only one way to go out. GEORGE How's that? JOHN Singing! RINGO One... PAUL Two... GEORGE Three... JOHN ¡Fire! 1:27:33 THE BEATLES : ALL TOGETHER NOW One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more? Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea? E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you Sail the ship Chop the tree Skip the rope Look at me All together now All together now (all together now)… 1:28:42 CREDITSEmbed"
