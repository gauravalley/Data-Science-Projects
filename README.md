# Projects on Data Science and Data Analysis

This is a collection of Machine Learning and Data Analysis projects that I've done using data-driven tools such as Python, R and Power BI. It contains the following (listed alphabetically):
#### 1. Fetus Health Data: Analysis and Prediction Using ML Methods | Python
  Cleaning, exploring, visualizing and manipulating data about fetus health to create Machine Learning models that whether the fetus is healthy or unhealthy.
#### 2. Flight Fare Data: Analysis and Prediction Using ML Methods | Python
  Cleaning, exploring, visualizing and manipulating data about flight fares to create Machine Learning models that predict fares of future flights.
#### 3. Heart Stroke Data: Analysis and Prediction Using ML Methods | Python
  Cleaning, exploring, visualizing and manipulating data about patients to create Machine Learning models that predict if their susceptibility to a heart stroke.
#### 4. What Beatles Song Is That? | Python
  A model that recognizes the title of any Beatles song when you feed in the lyrics; constructed with data extracted from the Genius website using Genius API and the lyricsgenius Python library.
#### 5. What Movie Should I Watch Next? | Python
  A content-based movie recommendation system created using datasets extracted from the TMDB website through the TMDB API.
