# Projects on Data Science and Data Analysis

This is a collection of Machine Learning and Data Analysis projects that I've done using data-driven tools such as Python, R and Power BI. It contains the following (listed alphabetically):
## 1. Fetus Health Data: Analysis and Prediction Using ML Methods
# 2. Flight Fare Data: Analysis and Prediction Using ML Methods: 
  Cleaning, exploring, visualizing and manipulating data about flight fares to create Machine Learning models that predict fares of future flights.
# 3. Heart Stroke Data: Analysis and Prediction Using ML Methods
# 4. What Beatles Song Is That?: 
  A model that recognizes the title of any Beatles song when you feed in the lyrics; constructed with data extracted from the Genius website using Genius API and the lyricsgenius Python library.
# 5. What Movie Should I Watch Next?:
